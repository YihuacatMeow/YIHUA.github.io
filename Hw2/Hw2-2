My favorite sports.

I like to exercise, and I am good at every kind of ball games instead of baseball. As a fan in basketball, <span>I like the guy who wears the number of 30, naming Stephen Curry; I also like to watch volleyball games.</span> However, I do not watch baseball game because I don't like it and I consider it a waste of time.

<p>Baseball cracks me in every ways. <span>The stick</span> is so heavy that I could hardly carry on, and there is seldom <span>a place</span> with enough space to build up a baseball field.</p><br>
<div style="color: blue;">
Also, basebll needs more than 11 people to create a team. So actually I have rare chance to paly on it.
